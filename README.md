# mir-rs

The `mircomp-sys` crate is a set of auto-generated FFI bindings for [Vladimir Makarov's MIR](https://github.com/vnmakarov/mir) toolchain.

The `mircomp` crate is a safe Rust wrapper for `mircomp-sys` to allow more ergonomic use by other Rust projects.

Please note that neither this project nor Makarov's are related to Rust's [Mid-level IR](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html).
